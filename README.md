# IMDB_top250GUI <br/>
I made a desktop gui that shows IMDB Top 250 list, data got from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) and parsed with beautifulsoup.
This GUI, includes options that Top 10, Top 30, Top 50 and Top 100 and it also default initialize as Top 250 means that when user push a show button
list is going to fill with 250 movies. Also user can search the movie with rating options.
